## The Fog Lifts: Why 2025 Is the Year of "The Fool"

If you have been monitoring the pulse of global fantasy fiction or the exploding landscape of Chinese animation (donghua), you know that 2025 has effectively become the "Year of the Mystery." With the long-awaited animated adaptation finally premiering in June 2025 to critical acclaim—shattering viewership records on Tencent Video and making massive waves on global streaming platforms—and the recent November 2025 trailer reveal for the open-world RPG *Code: Mystery*, the franchise has transcended its status as a cult classic web novel to become a multimedia juggernaut.

But what exactly is *Lord of the Mysteries* (LOTM)? Why does a web novel that concluded its first book years ago continue to dominate discussions on Reddit, TikTok, and Discord? And more importantly, why should you dive into this sprawling, maddeningly brilliant universe right now?

At its core, *Lord of the Mysteries* is a masterclass in genre-blending. It is not merely a story about magic; it is a philosophical examination of humanity’s fragility in the face of the unknown, wrapped in the smoke and gears of a Victorian steampunk aesthetic, and corrupted by the cosmic horror of H.P. Lovecraft.

## The Premise: The Clock Strikes Midnight

The story begins with a headache. Zhou Mingrui, a modern-day keyboard warrior and food lover, performs a luck-enhancement ritual he found online. Instead of good fortune, he finds himself transported—transmigrated—into the body of Klein Moretti, a history graduate in a world that resembles Victorian England.

This world is not Earth, though it shares its moon (which turns a terrifying crimson). This is a world where the Industrial Revolution is powered not just by steam, but by the occult. Here, the "Seven Orthodox Deities" watch over humanity, keeping the creeping madness of the cosmos at bay. But in the shadows, secret organizations, evil cults, and unspeakable entities vie for power.

Klein’s journey isn't a typical power fantasy. He doesn't wake up with a cheat system or an invincible sword. He wakes up with a gun in his hand, a suicide note he didn't write on his desk, and a hole in his head that is miraculously healing. To survive, and to find a way home, he must step into the world of "Beyonders"—individuals who consume magical potions to gain powers.

## The 22 Paths of the Divine: A System Like No Other

The magic system of *Lord of the Mysteries* is arguably its crowning achievement. Unlike standard fantasy where mana is just a fuel source, magic here is a curse.

There are **22 Divine Pathways** (e.g., The Seer, The Apprentice, The Marauder, The Spectator), each corresponding to a Tarot card. Each pathway has 10 sequences, ranging from Sequence 9 (the weakest) to Sequence 0 (a True God).
To advance, a Beyonder must consume a potion made of specific mystical ingredients—often harvested from monsters that were once humans who failed to handle the power.

But here is the twist that defines the series: **The Law of Beyonder Characteristics Conservation**. Power is never created or destroyed; it is only transferred. Every potion you drink contains the spiritual residue and madness of its previous owners. To consume a potion is to invite the whispers of the dead into your mind.

### The Acting Method: Survival of the Falsest

How does one stop the madness from taking over? This is where the novel introduces its most unique concept: **The Acting Method**.

To digest a potion and stabilize the power, a Beyonder must "act" according to the name of their potion.
*   If you are a **Seer** (Sequence 9), you must actually divine fortunes for people.
*   If you are a **Clown** (Sequence 8), you must smile even when you want to cry; you must perform fate's mockery.
*   If you are a **Magician** (Sequence 7), you must perform miracles, but never perform unprepared.

This mechanic turns every battle into a psychological thriller. Characters aren't just fighting enemies; they are fighting to maintain their own persona. They must embody their role perfectly without losing themselves *to* the role. The line between "Acting" and "Being" blurs, and that is where the true horror lies.

## The World-Building: Steampunk Meets Cthulhu

The setting of the novel, primarily the Loen Kingdom and its smog-filled capital, Backlund, is a character in itself. The author, *Cuttlefish That Loves Diving*, has meticulously crafted a world that feels economically and sociologically grounded. We see the poverty of the East Borough, where workers die of lung disease from factory smog, contrasted with the opulent balls of the nobility who play with artifacts that could end the world.

The lore is deep—abyssal deep. The history of the world is divided into Epochs, each shrouded in a "Fog of History." As Klein advances, he peels back these layers, discovering that the "gods" people worship might not be what they seem, and the history books are filled with lies written by the victors.

The presence of the **Tarot Club** serves as the narrative anchor. Early in the story, Klein inadvertently creates a secret gathering in a mysterious dimension above the gray fog. He assumes the persona of "The Fool," a mysterious, god-like entity. He pulls in members from across the world, assigning them Tarot code names (The Justice, The Hanged Man, The Sun, etc.).
Watching Klein bluff his way through these meetings, pretending to be an omnipotent deity while actually being a broke detective worrying about the price of potatoes, creates a delicious dramatic irony that balances the grim tone of the series.

## Latest Developments: The Era of 1368 and Beyond

As of late 2025, the *Lord of the Mysteries* universe has expanded significantly. While the first book tells the complete story of Klein Moretti, the sequel, **"Circle of Inevitability" (Book 2)**, is currently keeping readers on the edge of their seats.

Set roughly six years after the end of Book 1, in the year 1368, *Circle of Inevitability* shifts the focus to the Intis Republic and a new protagonist, **Lumian Lee**. If Klein’s story was about caution and planning, Lumian’s story is a dance with chaos. The sequel expands the lore into the "Western Continent" and delves deeper into the **Outer Deities**—cosmic horrors circling the planet, waiting for the barrier to fall.

For fans of the original, the sequel provides tantalizing glimpses of the Tarot Club members, who have now become legendary figures moving the chessboard from the shadows. The question on everyone's mind in the current chapters (around ch. 1180+) is the ultimate fate of The Fool, who remains in a deep slumber, battling the will of the Celestial Worthy.

## Why You Should Read (and Watch) It Now

The release of the anime in June 2025 has provided the perfect entry point for visual learners. The studio, B.CMAY Pictures, managed to capture the grotesque beauty of the spirit world and the Victorian grime perfectly. However, the novel remains the definitive experience. The internal monologues of Klein, his deductive reasoning, and the intricate descriptions of the occult rituals are things that visual media can only partially capture.

Moreover, with the **"Code: Mystery"** game ramping up for what looks like a global launch soon, understanding the lore gives you a massive appreciation for the mechanics. The game promises to let players choose their own Pathway. Imagine playing an RPG where "leveling up" requires you to roleplay a specific persona in the game's social ecosystem to avoid a "Game Over" by insanity. That is the promise of the LOTM IP.

## Conclusion: Praise The Fool

*Lord of the Mysteries* is not just a story; it is an experience of uncovering the truth. It challenges the reader to piece together clues alongside the protagonist. It asks difficult questions: Is it better to be a happy, ignorant human or a mad, knowledgeable god? What is the price of protecting those you love in a world designed to corrupt you?

The prose is sharp, the mysteries are mind-bending, and the payoff is immense. Whether you start with the newly released anime or dive straight into the 1400-chapter web novel, you are in for a journey that will leave you questioning the reality behind the crimson moon.

So, pour yourself a cup of black tea, tap the table four times, and recite the honorific name:

> *The Fool that doesn't belong to this era,*
> *The Mysterious Ruler above the gray fog,*
> *The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck.*

Welcome to the Tarot Club. Your seat is waiting.
