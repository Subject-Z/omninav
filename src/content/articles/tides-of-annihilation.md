# Reality has shattered. The Round Table is dead. You are the only hope left.

In **Tides of Annihilation**, a high-octane Action RPG, the boundaries between worlds have collapsed. An unknown dimension has devoured modern London, twisting landmarks into alien structures and transmuting organic life into cold, inorganic matter.

As **Gwendolyn**, the sole survivor of this cataclysm, you must journey through a fragmented cityscape where fantasy and reality violently collide. Armed with the power to summon legendary spirits, you will hunt for the shards of the Holy Grail, challenge the corruption of the Otherworld, and rewrite a destiny that has already been written.

With the fragmented reality closing in and rivals seeking the throne of a dead kingdom, Gwendolyn must rise from a survivor to a savior.
